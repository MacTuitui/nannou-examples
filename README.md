# nannou examples

A collection (eventually) of examples that use some non-beginner things.

Right now the only example combines nannou's standard `draw` API on top
of instance rendering and a two-pass full screen shader pass (for effects, here
blur).

I tried my best to comment the why and how this work, but this can get 
pretty confusing if you don't really follow how WebGPU works 
(and nannou does a great job at keeping it hidden yet available!).
